## bSecure Single Sign On (SSO)

### Routing

Next, you are ready to authenticate users! You will need two routes: one for redirecting the user to the OAuth provider, and another for receiving the customer profile from the provider after authentication.

### Authenticate Client

> If you are using a web-solution then use below method

```JavaScript

(async () => {
  try {
    let status = bsecure.SingleSignOn;
    let result = await status.authenticateClient("<STATE>");
    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error(err)  }
})();

```

In response, authenticateWebClient will return auth_url, then simply redirect the user to auth_url

```
{
  "auth_url": "your-authentication-url"
}
```

### Client Authorization

On Successful Authorization,\
bSecure will redirect to Login redirect url you provided when setting up environment in Builder's portal, along
with two parameters in query string: **code** and **state**

```
eg: https://my-store.com/sso-callback?code=abc&state=xyz
```

code recieved in above callback is cutsomer's auth_code which will be further used to get customer profile.

#### Verify Callback

Verify the state you received in the callback by matching it to the value you stored in DB before sending the client authentication
request, you should only proceed if and only if both values match.

### Get Customer Profile

Auth_code recieved from **Client Authorization** should be passed to method below to get customer profile.

```JavaScript
(async () => {
  try {
    let status = bsecure.SingleSignOn;
    let result = await status.getCustomerProfile("<AUTH-CODE>");
    return result;
  } catch (err) {
    throw new Error(err)  }
})();

```

In response, it will return customer name, email, phone_number, country_code, address book.

```
{
    "name": "customer-name",
    "email": "customer-email",
    "phone_number": "customer-phone-number",
    "country_code": "customer-phone-cod",
    "address":
      {
        "country": "",
        "state": "",
        "city": "",
        "area": "",
        "address": "",
        "postal_code": "",
      },
}
```
